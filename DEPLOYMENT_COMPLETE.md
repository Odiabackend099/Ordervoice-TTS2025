## 🎓 Knowledge Base

### Common Questions

**Q: Is the voice demo working?**

**Q: How do I add my own API keys?**
A: Set environment variables in Vercel/Netlify dashboard. Never commit keys to git. See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` > Environment Variables.

A: Edit `pricing.html`. Current tiers: Starter (₦40k), Pro (₦95k), Business (₦220k).

**Q: Where are form submissions stored?**
